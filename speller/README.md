# Speller

This program loads a dictionary and a text file and outputs the words not in the dictionary. i.e. a spell checker!

Implementing the hashtable and the DIY hash-function was the real challenge. My implementation is not going to win any competititons, but it is not attrocious. 

dictionary.c is where all the action is.
